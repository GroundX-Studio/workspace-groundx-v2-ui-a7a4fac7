# Workflows

This reference covers the ten workflow operations: creating, listing, getting, updating,
and deleting workflow definitions; looking up the account-level workflow assignment;
assigning and removing a workflow from the account; and assigning and removing a workflow
from a specific group or bucket.

## 1. Workflow overview

A workflow defines the agentic processing pipeline applied to documents during ingest.
`processLevel` controls whether GroundX runs that agentic reprocessing at all:
`full` runs OCR / text extraction, chunking, and the workflow-configurable agentic
pipeline; `none` runs OCR / text extraction and basic chunking but skips GroundX
agentic reprocessing. The workflow controls the details of *how* the `full` pipeline
behaves — chunking strategy, section strategy, custom LLM steps, and extract agent
definitions.

Workflows can also normalize language for RAG: use ingest-time steps to translate
non-English documents into English, and either pre-translate queries or customize the
`search-query` stage to translate/rewrite queries into English before retrieval. If you
do not normalize, keep one language per bucket and configure the bucket for that
language.

For a full conceptual explanation of the pipeline, steps, element types, fields,
strategies, and SDK objects, see `guides/09-workflows.md`.

### 1.1 Workflow scope hierarchy

Workflows can be assigned at three levels. More specific assignments override broader ones:

1. **Account level** — applies to all ingested files by default
2. **Group or bucket level** — overrides the account-level workflow for files in that group or bucket
3. **Document processing depth** — `processLevel` can opt an individual document out of
   the agentic workflow pipeline by using `none` (§1.2 in 02-documents.md)

### 1.2 Workflow fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflowId` | UUID assigned at creation |
| `name` | Display name |
| `chunkStrategy` | How document content is chunked: `element` (by structural element) or `size` (by approximate token size) |
| `sectionStrategy` | How sections are handled: `chunks` (multiple chunks per section) or `page` (one section per page) |
| `steps` | Custom processing steps — see §1.3 and `guides/09-workflows.md` §6 |
| `extract` | Extract agent definitions |

### 1.3 Custom LLM steps

Any pipeline step can be configured with either a custom prompt (using GroundX's
built-in LLM) or a custom LLM endpoint.

#### Pipeline-stage identifiers vs output field names

There are two distinct vocabularies that share a prefix and are easy to confuse: the
nine **pipeline-stage identifiers** (the keys on `WorkflowSteps`) and the eight
**output field names** (the values accepted by `WorkflowStepConfig.field`).

| Pipeline-stage identifier (`WorkflowSteps` key / wire form) | Output field name (`WorkflowStepConfig.field` value) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `doc-summary` | `doc-sum` | Document-level summary stage. |
| `doc-keys` | `doc-keys` | Document-level keywords stage. |
| `sect-summary` | `sect-sum` | Section-level summary stage. |
| `sect-instruct` | _(no `field=` value — see below)_ | Section-level instructions stage. |
| `sect-keys` | `sect-keys` | Section-level keywords stage. |
| `chunk-summary` | `chunk-sum` | Chunk-level summary stage. |
| `chunk-instruct` | `chunk-instruct` | Chunk-level instructions stage. |
| `chunk-keys` | `chunk-keys` | Chunk-level keywords stage. |
| `search-query` | _(no `field=` value)_ | Search-query rewriting stage. |
| _(any stage)_ | `text` | Write the agent's text output back into the chunk's primary text. |

Two notes that bite:

- **The `field=` enum is narrower than the stage list.** The canonical `field=` values
  per the SDK's `WorkflowStepConfigField` literal are the eight in the right column
  above. The stage identifiers `sect-instruct` and `search-query` are
  **not** in that literal — and the server **silently drops them to `null`** when
  passed (no error, no rejection — just `field` ends up unset on the stored workflow).
  Don't use a stage name where a field name is expected; the SDK literal is the
  authoritative list.
- **Per-stage element-type targeting.** Each step configuration targets one or more
  element types (`all`, `paragraph`, `table`, `figure`, `json`, `table-figure`) — these
  appear as the keys on the `WorkflowStep` SDK class. On the wire the key is `table-figure`;
  the SDK attribute is `table_figure` (and `all` / `json` become `all_` / `json_` in
  Python because they collide with builtins).

See `references/12-python-sdk-objects.md` §6–§9 for the full SDK class details and
the same vocabulary table.

#### Engine configuration

To use a **custom LLM endpoint** instead of GroundX's built-in model for a step,
supply an `engine` object. The same field exists on the wire and on the
`WorkflowEngine` SDK class — wire form is camelCase, SDK form is snake_case:

| Wire/REST key | Python SDK attr | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | `api_key` | Bearer token for the custom LLM endpoint. |
| `baseURL` | `base_url` | Base URL of an OpenAI chat completion-compatible endpoint. |
| `engineID` | `engine_id` | Model name to include in the request. |
| `service` | `service` | Identifies the kind of endpoint — see §1.3.1 below. The field name is `service` on **both** wire and SDK; earlier versions of this reference incorrectly called it `serviceType`. |
| `reasoningEffort` | `reasoning_effort` | One of: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`. |

See `references/12-python-sdk-objects.md` §3 for the `WorkflowEngine` constructor
example.

### 1.3.1 service vocabulary

`service` is a label describing the kind of OpenAI-compatible endpoint the
engine points at. In practice it does almost nothing — its only behavior is that
two values prepopulate `baseURL` when `baseURL` is not explicitly set. Beyond
that, it is account metadata. The **canonical** values (those listed in the SDK's
`WorkflowEngineService` literal) are:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `openai` | Prepopulates the public OpenAI `baseURL`. Override by setting `baseURL` explicitly. |
| `openai-base64` | Same prepopulation as `openai`, but images are base64-encoded into the request payload instead of referenced by URL. Use this against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — including a hosted one — when the model cannot fetch URLs (network-isolated, private deployment, or the provider doesn't accept image URLs). |
| `azure` | Prepopulates the Azure OpenAI `baseURL`. Override by setting `baseURL` explicitly. |
| `deep-infra` | Account metadata only — no prepopulation. `baseURL` must be supplied. Use for a DeepInfra-hosted endpoint. |
| `hosted` | Account metadata only — no prepopulation. `baseURL` must be supplied. Use for any other third-party-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |

Only `openai` and `azure` (and their `-base64` variants) actually drive endpoint
behavior. The other values are labels for accounting and reporting; the request
is determined by the explicit `baseURL`, `engineID`, and `apiKey`. Pick whichever
value most accurately describes the deployment.

The server currently still accepts the legacy value `eyelevel` (used historically
for EyeLevel-self-hosted endpoints), but it was removed from the SDK
`WorkflowEngineService` literal — pass `hosted` (with an explicit `baseURL`) for
forward-compatibility.

For configuring **custom prompts** using GroundX's built-in LLM, use the
`WorkflowStepConfig` / `WorkflowPromptGroup` SDK objects described in
`guides/09-workflows.md` §6.

All `steps` and `extract` fields are optional — omit them to use GroundX defaults.

#### Updates are custom overlays

Workflow updates use the same model as workflow creation: the body describes the
custom overlay relative to GroundX defaults, not a delta against the previously
stored custom workflow. Send only the fields you want to customize. Omitted step
settings fall back to defaults.

A name-only update is not a metadata-only patch. If custom processing settings
should remain in effect, include those custom settings again in the update body.

| Update shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Step omitted | Use the default step and remove any previous custom override for that step. |
| Step value `null` | Disable/clear that default step. |
| Step config with only `engine` | Use the default step config and prompt with the custom engine. |
| `prompt` omitted or `prompt: {}` | Use the default prompt group. |
| `prompt: null` | Use no prompt group for that step config. |
| `prompt.request: null` or `prompt.task: null` | Clear only that prompt member and default omitted members. |
| `prompt.request` or `prompt.task` object | Use the supplied custom prompt member and default omitted members. |

If you are working against a backend that predates default-overlay workflow
updates, send explicit prompt objects for any step that must not become empty.

## 2. workflow_create / POST /v1/workflow

Create a new workflow definition. All fields are optional — creating a workflow with no
fields creates a default-configuration workflow.

**MCP:**
```json
{
  "name": "technical-docs",
  "chunkStrategy": "element",
  "sectionStrategy": "chunks"
}
```
Tool: `workflow_create` → returns `workflow.workflowId`

**REST:**
```http
POST /v1/workflow
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "technical-docs",
  "chunkStrategy": "element",
  "sectionStrategy": "chunks"
}
```

**Response:** `{ "workflow": { "workflowId": "uuid", "name": "technical-docs", ... } }`

## 3. workflow_list / GET /v1/workflow

List all workflow definitions associated with the API key.

**MCP:**
```json
{}
```
Tool: `workflow_list`

**REST:**
```http
GET /v1/workflow
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "workflows": [...] }` — array of workflow objects.

## 4. workflow_get / GET /v1/workflow/{id}

Look up a workflow by its `workflowId` (UUID), or by a `groupId` or `bucketId` to find
the workflow currently assigned to that group or bucket.

**MCP:**
```json
{ "id": "workflow-uuid" }
```
Tool: `workflow_get`

**REST:**
```http
GET /v1/workflow/workflow-uuid
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "workflow": { ... } }` — workflow object.

## 5. workflow_update / PUT /v1/workflow/{id}

Update an existing workflow definition. Supply the desired custom overlay relative
to GroundX defaults. Omitted step settings return to defaults; they do not
preserve previous custom values. This also applies when the update changes only
the workflow name.

**MCP:**
```json
{
  "id": "workflow-uuid",
  "name": "technical-docs-v2",
  "chunkStrategy": "size"
}
```
Tool: `workflow_update`

**REST:**
```http
PUT /v1/workflow/workflow-uuid
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "technical-docs-v2",
  "chunkStrategy": "size"
}
```

**Input parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | UUID of the workflow to update (path) |
| `name` | no | New display name for the workflow (body) |
| `chunkStrategy` | no | Chunking strategy: `element` or `size` (body) |
| `sectionStrategy` | no | Section strategy: `chunks` or `page` (body) |
| `steps` | no | Custom processing steps object (body) |
| `extract` | no | Extract agent definitions object (body) |

**Response:** Updated workflow object.

To customize only a step engine, keep the overlay narrow:

```json
{
  "id": "workflow-uuid",
  "steps": {
    "chunk-summary": {
      "all": {
        "engine": {
          "apiKey": "CUSTOM_PROVIDER_KEY",
          "baseURL": "https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai",
          "engineID": "EyeLevel/gemma-4-31B-it-turbo",
          "service": "deep-infra"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Do not add `prompt: {}` to clear prompts; omit `prompt` or send `{}` to use the
default prompt group. To reset a previously customized or disabled step to
defaults, omit that step from the next update. If a stored workflow already shows
`prompt: {}` where custom prompts were expected, restore custom prompt text from
prior workflow JSON, logs, backups, or source YAML. For default prompts, resubmit
the desired overlay after the backend fix or recreate the workflow from a clean
source definition.

## 6. workflow_delete / DELETE /v1/workflow/{id}

Delete a workflow definition by its `workflowId`. This removes the definition but does
not affect documents already processed with it.

**MCP:**
```json
{ "id": "workflow-uuid" }
```
Tool: `workflow_delete`

**REST:**
```http
DELETE /v1/workflow/workflow-uuid
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "message": "OK" }`

## 7. workflow_get_account / GET /v1/workflow/relationship

Get the workflow currently assigned at the account level (the default workflow applied
to all files unless overridden).

**MCP:**
```json
{}
```
Tool: `workflow_get_account`

**REST:**
```http
GET /v1/workflow/relationship
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "workflow": { ... } }` — the account-level workflow, if one is assigned.

## 8. workflow_add_to_account / POST /v1/workflow/relationship

Assign a workflow to the account level. This becomes the default for all ingested files
unless a more specific assignment (group, bucket) overrides it.

**MCP:**
```json
{ "workflowId": "workflow-uuid" }
```
Tool: `workflow_add_to_account`

**REST:**
```http
POST /v1/workflow/relationship
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflowId": "workflow-uuid" }
```

**Response:** `{ "message": "OK" }`

## 9. workflow_remove_from_account / DELETE /v1/workflow/relationship

Remove the account-level workflow assignment. After removal, ingest uses the GroundX
default processing unless a group- or bucket-level workflow is assigned.

**MCP:**
```json
{}
```
Tool: `workflow_remove_from_account`

**REST:**
```http
DELETE /v1/workflow/relationship
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "message": "OK" }`

## 10. workflow_add_to_id / POST /v1/workflow/relationship/{id}

Assign a workflow to a specific group or bucket. Files ingested into that group or bucket
will use this workflow instead of the account-level default.

**MCP:**
```json
{ "id": 1234, "workflowId": "workflow-uuid" }
```
Tool: `workflow_add_to_id`

**REST:**
```http
POST /v1/workflow/relationship/1234
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflowId": "workflow-uuid" }
```

**Input parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | ID of the group or bucket to assign the workflow to (path) |
| `workflowId` | yes | UUID of the workflow to assign (body) |

**Response:** `{ "message": "OK" }`

## 11. workflow_remove_from_id / DELETE /v1/workflow/relationship/{id}

Remove the workflow assignment from the group or bucket identified by `id`. After
removal, the account-level workflow (if any) applies again.

**MCP:**
```json
{ "id": 1234 }
```
Tool: `workflow_remove_from_id`

**REST:**
```http
DELETE /v1/workflow/relationship/1234
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Response:** `{ "message": "OK" }`
