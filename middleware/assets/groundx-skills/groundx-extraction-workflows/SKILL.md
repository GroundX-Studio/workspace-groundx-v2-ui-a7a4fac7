  Use this skill when an agent needs to extract structured data from a PDF
  or other document using GroundX. Triggers include drafting or iterating an
  extraction YAML schema, compiling workflow JSON, running an extraction,
  comparing output to ground truth, debugging missing or wrong fields, and
  planning a serious extraction pilot. Platform API operations delegate to
  `groundx-api`.

# GroundX Extraction Workflows

This skill is schema-first: the durable artifact is a YAML schema;
`compile_workflow.py` translates it into workflow JSON; `deploy_workflow.py`
deploys a finished YAML through the GroundX Python SDK; `run_extraction.py`
runs the full ingest/poll/X-Ray/extract loop. Interactive platform execution
delegates to `groundx-api`.

For public or customer-facing extraction documentation, read
`references/public-docs.md` first. Public docs should use the GroundX SDK path,
including `client.ingest(...)`, and keep harness/compiler internals out unless
the user explicitly asks for SDK internals.

## Routing Contract

- **Role:** `artifact`.
- **First-entry intents:** schema-first extraction, extraction YAML, extraction
  workflow authoring, compile-to-workflow JSON, field-accuracy iteration, pilot
  acceptance criteria, or comparison to ground truth.
- **Deferrals:** interactive workflow registration, bucket attachment, document
  ingest, polling, and extraction retrieval route to `groundx-api`; on-prem
  deployment questions route to `groundx-on-prem`; architecture questions route to
  `groundx-architecture`.
- **Before producing output:** read this skill's reference index and schema/compiler
  guidance before drafting YAML or workflow JSON.
- **Misuse cases:** do not put real API keys in generated files, examples, logs,
  prompts, or transcripts. Use `deploy_workflow.py` for local deploy-only SDK
  execution, `groundx-api` MCP for interactive agent operations, and
  `run_extraction.py` for deploy + ingest + poll + X-Ray + extract.

## Fast Path

1. Read `references/README.md`.
2. For public or customer-facing docs, read `references/public-docs.md`.
3. For a new customer or serious pilot, read `references/customer-onboarding.md` and
   optionally `references/openspec-pilots.md`.
4. Draft or revise `prompt.yaml` using `references/2_schema_design.md` and
   `references/3_prompt_pipeline.md`.
5. If the domain needs custom extract/reconcile/QA prompt wrappers, read
   `references/prompt-manager.md` and use `templates/prompt_manager.py` as the
   minimal today-path manager.
6. Compile the YAML into `workflow.json` with `templates/compile_workflow.py`.
7. For a finished YAML, read `references/deploy.md`, then use
   `templates/deploy_workflow.py` to deploy the workflow through the GroundX Python SDK.
   For a full local run, use
   `templates/run_extraction.py`. For interactive platform execution, route to
   `groundx-api`.
8. Score against ground truth: `templates/score_extraction.py` for one document, or
   `templates/batch_extraction.py` to ingest + score a folder live. To re-score a captured
   run **offline (no re-ingest)** — after editing answer keys or to score on another
   machine — use `templates/batch_score.py <run_dir> --keys-dir <keys>`.
9. Iterate one field at a time; inspect X-Ray before tightening prompts when accuracy
   stalls or a field is wrong.

## What This Skill Produces

This skill produces `prompt.yaml`, compiled `workflow.json`, extracted JSON after
`groundx-api` execution, deploy metadata from `templates/deploy_workflow.py`, an
accuracy report when ground truth exists, and the minimal
`templates/prompt_manager.py` manager shape when custom prompt wrappers are needed. A
full deployable project scaffold is not part of the default deliverable.

## Pre-return Checklist

- [ ] YAML remains the durable source of truth.
- [ ] Workflow JSON is reproducible from YAML.
- [ ] Finished-YAML deploy uses `deploy_workflow.py`; interactive platform execution
      delegates to `groundx-api`.
- [ ] No real GroundX API key appears in any artifact.
- [ ] Group decomposition is explicit.
- [ ] Field fixes identify the specific YAML line or field to change.
- [ ] X-Ray was inspected before tightening prompts when accuracy stalls.
