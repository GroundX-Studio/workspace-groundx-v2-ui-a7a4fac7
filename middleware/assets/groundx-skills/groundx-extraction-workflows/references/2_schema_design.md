# 2. Schema design

The YAML schema is the durable artifact. Every other output of this skill
derives from it. This reference describes how to author one well.

## 1. Final groups, workflow groups, and workflow execution

A GroundX extraction schema has real top-level groups that define the **final
data object**. These names are the customer-facing output contract after
extraction and reassembly.

New harness-authored workflow YAML must set top-level
`extraction_policy_version: v1`.

Workflow execution can use those same real top-level groups directly, or it can
use `_pseudo_groups` when a final group must be split into smaller workflow
groups and recombined later.

For new custom extraction workflows, put executable step definitions under
top-level `workflow.custom_steps`. Direct workflow groups declare
`workflow_step: <custom_step_name>` on the group and `workflow_output_key` on
routed fields. Pseudo workflow groups declare `workflow_step` on the pseudo
group; the pseudo field key is the workflow output key and `path` points back to
the final field. Output keys must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`. The compiler
emits the public workflow fields `customSteps`, `outputRoutes`, `leafFields`,
and optional workflow-level `template`; X-Ray readback uses
`customChunkOutputs`, `customSectionOutputs`, and `customDocumentOutputs`.

Every harness-authored v1 YAML must also declare `workflow.agent_chain`. This
is the runtime task schedule. It references workflow groups, not customer names:
use the real group name for direct groups and the pseudo group name for
`_pseudo_groups`. The runtime task names remain internal role names such as
`reconcile_statement`, `qa_statement`, `save_statement`, `reconcile_charges`,
`save_charges`, `reconcile_meters`, `qa_meters`, and `save_meters`.

The harness compiler accepts only the custom workflow shape. Define each
executable step under `workflow.custom_steps`, then assign each direct workflow
group or pseudo group to one step with group-level `workflow_step:`. Do not put
`workflow_step` on fields. The SDK preparation layer emits `customSteps`,
`outputRoutes`, and `leafFields`; local X-Ray readback uses
`customChunkOutputs`, `customSectionOutputs`, or `customDocumentOutputs`.

Use step kinds to describe the extraction shape:

| Step kind | Output shape | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `instruct` | One flat object | Per-document fields that appear once per file |
| `keys` | Array of objects | Repeating records such as charge lines, line items, transactions, or service rows |
| `summary` | Array of objects | A second repeating record type such as physical meters or usage records |

Both `keys` and `summary` are repeated-output kinds. They both produce arrays
of objects when routed to a direct final group. Do not read `summary` as "one
document summary object"; use `kind: instruct` for one object.

For example, a custom step named `charge_lines` uses `kind: keys` because it
extracts many records with the same shape. Each chunk returns zero or more
complete charge objects, and GroundX aggregates those objects into an array.
Do not use `kind: keys` for a field that should appear once in the final JSON;
use `kind: instruct` for those fields.

The `level` controls where the step runs:

| Level | Readback map | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `chunk` | `customChunkOutputs` | Most extraction work; each chunk sees local text and page evidence |
| `section` | `customSectionOutputs` | Section-level summaries or records when chunks are too narrow |
| `document` | `customDocumentOutputs` | Document-level aggregation when a full-document step is supported |

`kind: instruct` is invalid with `level: document` in the harness validator.

Before live ingest, estimate request fanout:

- `chunk_requests ~= pages * chunks per page * chunk-level custom steps`
- `section_requests ~= pages * section-level custom steps` only when
  `workflow.section_strategy: page`
- `document_requests ~= document-level custom steps`

Pseudo groups reduce field and prompt load, but pseudo groups at `level: chunk`
still multiply requests. If statement-style fields are split into many broad
pseudo groups and expected documents may be long, use `workflow.section_strategy: page`
with `level: section` for those broad statement passes. Keep chunk level for
local repeating rows when the estimate stays below the warning threshold.

The harness intentionally does not load `domain:` or `slot:` YAML forms. Use the
public GroundX Python SDK helper directly when you need SDK-level YAML loading
outside the harness templates. Omit any final group a document does not have.
Compile from authored v1 source YAML only; generated `workflow.json`, downloaded
workflow readback, and `_groundx_persisted_extract` payloads are not source
YAML.

The compiler validates this source whitelist before SDK preparation or offline
fallback compile:

| Location | Allowed source shape |
|---|---|
| Top level | `extraction_policy_version`, `workflow`, `_defs`, `_pseudo_groups`, and real final group mappings |
| `workflow` | `custom_steps`, `agent_chain`, optional `template`, optional `section_strategy` |
| `workflow.custom_steps[]` | `name`, `level`, `kind`, optional `config`, optional `required_template_keys` |
| Direct final group | `fields`, optional `include`, optional `prompt`, optional `workflow_step`, and supported final-group business-logic metadata |
| `_defs.*` | required `fields`, optional `include`; no prompt or group metadata |
| `_pseudo_groups.*` | `workflow_step`, `fields`, and optional group `prompt`; no `include` |
| Direct leaf field | `prompt`, plus `workflow_output_key` when the final group has direct `workflow_step` |
| Pseudo field | `path`, plus optional full `prompt` override; the pseudo field key is the workflow output key |
| Field `prompt` | required `description`, `identifiers`, `instructions`, and `type`; optional `format` |

Nested final fields are not supported yet. Model nested structures as flat
fields or JSON-encoded string fields until route parsing supports paths deeper
than `/group/field`.

Supported final-group business-logic metadata keys are `always_check_attrs`,
`conflict_attrs`, `deregulation_status_values`,
`equivalent_service_types`, `exclude_dict_attrs`, `explanation_attrs`,
`fill_rules`, `final_value_aliases`, `match_attrs`,
`not_required_service_types`, `partial_pair_attrs`, `passthrough`,
`passthrough_attrs`, `passthrough_pair_attrs`, `remaining_attrs`,
`required_any_attrs`, `required_attrs`, and `unique_attrs`.

### Runtime role labels

When a workflow needs runner-side structured-output reassembly, final groups
and pseudo groups also need a processing role. These names are runtime role
labels, not customer names:

- `statement`: fields at the top level of the final structured object.
- `meters`: one top-level array of meter objects.
- `charges`: charge objects either at the top level or inside individual meter
  objects.

Charges attach to meters through `match_attrs`; unmatched charges remain at
statement level. Current runtime constraints allow only one `meters` group and
one `charges` group, including pseudo groups. All other groups are `statement`.
This is current implementation behavior, not a permanent product rule.

For workflows where every workflow group uses the `statement` role, plan one
`reconcile_statement -> qa_statement` branch per pseudo group, then
save/reassemble once all branches complete.

The public syntax walkthrough is
[Structured Extraction Workflow](https://docs.groundx.ai/documentation/structured-extraction-workflow).

### 1.1 `_defs` and `_pseudo_groups`

`_defs` is a fields-only authoring helper. Shared prompt context belongs under
real final groups, not inside `_defs`.

Use `include` only on `_defs` fragments or real final groups. A `_defs` fragment
contains `fields:` and optional `include:`. A final group may include one
fragment or a list of fragments, then add its own `fields:`. Duplicate final
field names, unknown includes, cyclic includes, field-level `include`, and
pseudo-group `include` are invalid.

Use `_pseudo_groups` only when a final group is too large for one extraction
agent but the final JSON shape must stay stable. Pseudo groups are
workflow-only. They are never final output keys.

```yaml
extraction_policy_version: v1

workflow:
  custom_steps:
    - name: eligibility_1_11
      level: chunk
      kind: instruct
  agent_chain:
    - parallel:
        - group: eligibility_1_11
          chain: [reconcile_statement, qa_statement]
    - save_statement

eligibility_requirements:
  fields:
    age_requirement:
      prompt: { ... }

_pseudo_groups:
  eligibility_1_11:
    workflow_step: eligibility_1_11
    fields:
      f033_age_requirement:
        path: /eligibility_requirements/age_requirement
```

Rules:

- Keep the final field prompts under the real final group.
- Put `workflow_step` on the pseudo group, not on fields.
- Use the pseudo field key as the workflow output key.
- Put `path` on every pseudo field so it routes back to a real final field.
- Do not combine direct `workflow_step` and pseudo routing for the same final
  group.

### 1.2 statement: per-document fields

Use this group for fields that appear once per document, even if they are
scattered across pages: account numbers, dates, totals, addresses,
identifiers. Each chunk of the document contributes whichever of these
fields it can see; the platform reconciles them into one flat object.

The `statement` group appears as an object in the extraction output:

```yaml
extraction_policy_version: v1

workflow:
  custom_steps:
    - name: statement_fields
      level: chunk
      kind: instruct
  agent_chain:
    - parallel:
        - group: statement
          chain: [reconcile_statement, qa_statement]
    - save_statement

statement:
  workflow_step: statement_fields
  fields:
    invoice_date:
      workflow_output_key: invoice_date
      prompt: { ... }
    total_due:
      workflow_output_key: total_due
      prompt: { ... }
```

```json
{
  "statement": {
    "invoice_date": "2026-01-22",
    "total_due": 38.99
  }
}
```

### 1.3 charges: repeating records

Use this group for records that repeat — typically line items, transactions,
charges, or service rows. Each chunk contributes complete records (not
partial fields of one record); the platform aggregates them into an array.

Compiled custom routes write the output under the authored final group key,
such as `charges`.

```yaml
workflow:
  custom_steps:
    - name: charge_lines
      level: chunk
      kind: keys
  agent_chain:
    - parallel:
        - group: charges
          chain: [reconcile_charges, save_charges]

charges:
  workflow_step: charge_lines
  fields:
    charge_description_as_printed:
      workflow_output_key: charge_description_as_printed
      prompt: { ... }
    charge_amount:
      workflow_output_key: charge_amount
      prompt: { ... }
```

```json
{
  "charges": [
    {
      "charge_description_as_printed": "Classic Cable - Bulk",
      "charge_amount": 36.75
    },
    {
      "charge_description_as_printed": "Franchise Fee",
      "charge_amount": 1.84
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1.4 meters: utility-style usage records

Use this group for utility-style per-meter usage records: documents where
each meter on a property reports its own consumption over a billing
period (kWh used, gallons consumed, demand readings). The intended
output shape is an array of meter objects, one per physical meter. In harness
YAML, meters are just another workflow group assigned to a custom step. Use
`kind: summary` when the meter extraction should produce a second repeating
record stream distinct from `kind: keys` charge lines. It still produces an
array of meter records.

For documents that contain metered services, define the concrete meter
fields in the group:

```yaml
workflow:
  custom_steps:
    - name: meter_records
      level: chunk
      kind: summary
  agent_chain:
    - parallel:
        - group: meters
          chain: [reconcile_meters, qa_meters, save_meters]

meters:
  workflow_step: meter_records
  prompt:
    instructions: |
      Extract one record per physical meter or metered service shown in
      the document. Do not invent meters that are not visible.
  fields:
    meter_number:
      workflow_output_key: meter_number
      prompt:
        description: "Meter identifier exactly as printed."
        identifiers: ["Meter #", "Meter Number"]
        instructions: "Return the printed meter identifier."
        type: str
    meter_usage:
      workflow_output_key: meter_usage
      prompt:
        description: "Usage quantity for this billing period."
        identifiers: ["Usage", "Consumption"]
        instructions: "Return the numeric usage value without units."
        type: float
```

The output appears under the `meters` array key:

```json
{
  "meters": [
    {
      "meter_number": "A12345",
      "meter_usage": 1842
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1.5 When the shape does not fit

If the document type is not a per-document object, a repeating record list,
or a metered-usage list (e.g. a free-form report with hierarchical structure),
the schema-first runner does not yet support it cleanly. The right path is to
surface this to the user and either model the document as one of the supported
shapes (typically `statement` with nested fields rendered as JSON strings) or
escalate per §3.3 in `6_known_limitations.md`.

### 1.6 Final group shape and agent load

Use **final group** for a functional grouping of fields in the final output,
such as `statement`, `charges`, or `meters`. Do not split the final data object
only because an agent has too many fields.

Keep each workflow group's extraction load to **30 fields or fewer**. The
compiler rejects executable workflow groups above that limit because LLM
cognitive load starts to work against accuracy and consistency. If a final
group grows beyond 30 fields, use
`_pseudo_groups` to split execution while recombining into the same final
group. Split into multiple real final groups only when that output shape is
what the user wants. Do not design one pre-process extraction agent per field.

## 2. Field anatomy

Every field in the YAML has the same shape. The field key under its group
becomes the JSON key inside that final group. In direct groups, routed fields
also declare `workflow_output_key`. In pseudo groups, the final field does not
need `workflow_output_key`; the pseudo field key is the workflow output key.
Use `16_prompt_writing.md` and `prompt-quality.md` when writing the
`description`, `identifiers`, `instructions`, and `format` text.

```yaml
field_key:
  workflow_output_key: field_key
  prompt:
    description: "..."
    format: "..."
    identifiers:
      - "Label 1"
      - "Label 2"
    instructions: "..."
    type: str
```

### 2.1 Required field keys

Every directly routed field also needs `workflow_output_key`. Use the field key
itself when it already matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`; otherwise choose a
safe snake_case internal key for the workflow output. For `_pseudo_groups`, put
that safe key in the pseudo field name and route it with `path`.

| Key | What it does | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_output_key` | Safe internal key used by direct custom workflow output routing | Yes for direct routed fields; no for pseudo-routed final fields |
| `description` | Plain-language description of what the field represents | Yes |
| `format` | Output format constraint | Optional but strongly recommended for dates and codes |
| `identifiers` | Label hints — where to look on the document | Yes |
| `instructions` | Extraction rules and edge cases | Yes |
| `type` | JSON value type: `str`, `int`, `float`, or `[int, float]` | Yes |

### 2.2 description

A short, factual sentence about what this value represents. The model uses
this as the field's purpose statement. Avoid restating the YAML key.

```yaml
description: the primary customer account identifier assigned by the provider
```

### 2.3 format

A constraint on the output format. Most useful for:

- Dates: always specify `YYYY-mm-dd date string` to force ISO format
- Codes: `ISO 4217 three-letter code`, `two-letter US state abbreviation`
- Numerics: leave unset; use `type` instead

```yaml
format: YYYY-mm-dd date string
```

### 2.4 identifiers

A list of labels or phrases that appear next to this value on the document.
The model uses these to locate the value on the page. Include the most
common 1–3 phrasings; do not enumerate exhaustively.

```yaml
identifiers:
  - Account Number
  - Acct #
```

If a value is rarely labeled (e.g. inferred from context), add one
identifier and explain the inference in `instructions`.

### 2.5 instructions

The most important key. A bulleted list of extraction rules, edge cases,
and negative examples. Each line is a directive to the model.

Patterns that produce reliable extractions:

- One concrete rule per line (model handles short directives better than
  long paragraphs)
- A formatting rule: "Strip any spaces or formatting characters"
- A disambiguation rule when the value collides with similar values on the
  page: "Do not confuse with invoice numbers, telephone numbers, or
  barcodes"
- A fallback rule when the value may be missing or implicit: "If no
  explicit invoice number is found, construct one by concatenating account
  number + invoice date in YYYYMMDD format"
- A casing or whitespace rule: "Preserve the original casing exactly as
  printed"

```yaml
instructions: |
  - Capture the full account number exactly as labeled
  - Strip any spaces or formatting characters
  - This must have an explicit "Account Number" label nearby
  - Do not confuse with invoice numbers, telephone numbers, or barcodes
```

### 2.6 type

The expected JSON value type. The model uses this to know whether to
return a string, integer, float, or numeric (either int or float).

```yaml
type: str          # for strings
type: int          # for integers only
type: float        # for floats only
type:              # for "either int or float" (most numeric fields)
  - int
  - float
```

If a `str` field needs to carry structured JSON, the prompt must say that the
JSON is encoded as a string. For example, use "Return a JSON-encoded string
representing an array of objects. Do not return an actual JSON array." Do not
write `type: str` with instructions that ask for a native JSON array or object.

## 3. Group-level prompts

The `charges` group accepts a top-level `prompt.instructions` block that
provides extraction rules for the group as a whole — not per-field, but
about how to identify what counts as one record. This is critical for
distinguishing individual records from subtotal or section-header lines.
Use `16_prompt_writing.md` and `prompt-quality.md` for the checklist before
editing group-level prompt text.

```yaml
charges:
  workflow_step: charge_lines
  fields:
    charge_description_as_printed:
      workflow_output_key: charge_description_as_printed
      prompt: { ... }
    charge_amount:
      workflow_output_key: charge_amount
      prompt: { ... }
  prompt:
    instructions: |
      Extract every individual line item.

      A record IS:
        - One distinct service charge with its own line and amount
        - One distinct tax or regulatory fee

      A record is NOT:
        - A section header or subtotal
        - A summary line aggregating multiple items
```

A group-level prompt is the single highest-leverage YAML edit when a
`charges`-style group over-extracts subtotals or under-extracts records.

## 4. Hardcoded field names

The GroundX platform requires two hardcoded field names for charge-style
extractions. Use these names exactly in the YAML even if the application
or expected answers use different names:

- `charge_amount` — numeric value
- `charge_description_as_printed` — verbatim description

Meter identifiers belong in the `meters` group unless the downstream charge
schema explicitly needs a meter identifier on each charge row.

The comparison harness matches by field name and scores null-vs-miss; answer
keys are JSON in the runner's output shape with field names that match the YAML.
See §1 in `6_known_limitations.md` for the platform-locked charge field names.

## 5. A worked example

`skills/groundx-extraction-workflows/examples/utility-invoice/prompt.yaml` is a
synthetic invoice-shaped schema: `statement`, `charges`, and `meters` groups with
custom workflow steps, per-field prompts, a group-level prompt that distinguishes
line items from subtotals, and inline business-logic metadata. Read it before
authoring a new schema for any invoice-shaped document.
`examples/insurance-claim/prompt.yaml` is the non-invoice custom-step
counterpart. Real customer schemas live out-of-repo, never in the skill.
