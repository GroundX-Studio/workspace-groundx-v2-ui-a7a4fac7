# Prompt Manager Today Path

This is the practical bridge for extraction pilots that need to work now. The
longer-term direction is for `groundx-python/extract` to turn one YAML into the
full extraction flow. Until that abstraction exists, use this convention to keep
customer code small and migration-friendly.

## 1. The Shape To Aim For

Keep `prompt.yaml` as the source of truth. Add thin Python wrappers only where
the domain needs prompt wording that the default compiler cannot express.
Use `references/16_prompt_writing.md` for the wording standard before changing
field prompts, group prompts, or wrapper prompts.

```
prompt.yaml
prompts/
  extract_statement.py
  reconcile_statement.py
  qa_statement.py
manager.py
```

The manager owns orchestration. The wrappers own language. The YAML owns final
fields and optional workflow grouping. Do not put real GroundX API keys in any
of these files.

## 2. Wrapper Function Contract

For a workflow group, keep extract wrapper functions keyed by the real group
name assigned to the custom step. The minimal manager adapter exposes methods
such as:

```python
def prompt_statement_extract_request(field_specs: str) -> str: ...
def prompt_statement_extract_task(field_descriptions: str) -> str: ...
```

Repeating groups use the same pattern:

```python
def prompt_charges_extract_request(field_specs: str, group_definition: str) -> str: ...
def prompt_charges_extract_task(field_descriptions: str) -> str: ...
def prompt_meters_extract_request(field_specs: str, group_definition: str) -> str: ...
def prompt_meters_extract_task(field_descriptions: str) -> str: ...
```

For reconcile and QA stages, keep explicit functions beside the extract
wrappers. These functions may run against workflow-group intermediate output,
final reassembled output, or both, but the boundary must be explicit:

```python
def prompt_statement_reconcile(*, candidate_json: dict, xray_context: dict) -> str: ...
def prompt_statement_qa(*, reconciled_json: dict, field_keys: list[str], field_prompts: dict) -> str: ...
```

The harness does not force exact argument names for reconcile/QA yet. It does
require the manager to make the inputs explicit: candidate state, field keys or
prompts, and source-document evidence such as page images or X-Ray context.

## 3. Manager Methods

Use `templates/prompt_manager.py` as the minimal adapter. A customer manager
should expose the same concepts even if method names differ:

- `workflow_body(yaml_path, workflow_name=None)` — compile YAML to a
  workflow body
- `workflow_steps(...)`, `workflow_extract_dict(...)`, and
  `persisted_workflow_extract_dict(...)` — expose workflow steps, execution
  groups, and the reloadable extraction contract separately for
  readback/comparison tests
- `prompt_statement_extract_request(...)`, `prompt_statement_extract_task(...)`,
  `prompt_charges_extract_request(...)`, `prompt_charges_extract_task(...)`,
  `prompt_meters_extract_request(...)`, and `prompt_meters_extract_task(...)`
  — default per-group extract wrapper methods that projects can override in a
  manager subclass or replace in project-specific manager code
- `prompt_statement_reconcile(...)` and `prompt_statement_qa(...)` — minimal
  reconcile/QA wrapper methods that make candidate state and evidence explicit
- `init_prompts(...)` — create a workflow
- `update_prompts(...)` — update an existing workflow
- `list_workflows()` and `check_workflow(...)` — inspect registered workflows
- `add_to_account(...)` / `remove_from_account()` — manage account default
- `add_to_id(...)` / `remove_from_id(...)` — manage bucket attachment
- `ingest_and_debug(...)` — ingest a file and capture both `get_extract` and
  `get_xray`

`groundx-api` remains the source of truth for endpoint semantics. This reference
owns the extraction-specific order and the manager convention.

Custom managers that are not compiling harness YAML should use the high-level
SDK workflow helpers when available:

```python
workflow = client.create_extraction_workflow(path="prompt.yaml", name="customer-workflow")
client.update_extraction_workflow(workflow.workflow.workflow_id, path="prompt.yaml")
existing = client.load_extraction_definition(workflow_id=workflow.workflow.workflow_id)
```

Managers that do compile harness YAML should deploy the compiled workflow body,
not re-load the same raw YAML path through the SDK after compilation. Use
prepared workflow groups for prompt rendering and workflow steps. Use the SDK
persisted workflow extract mapping for workflow JSON `extract`; that is the
payload downstream runtime can download and prepare again. Use prepared final
groups plus `workflow_field_paths` for readback, requiredness, QA, and final
output diagnostics. Do not reimplement pseudo-group routing or retired slot
behavior inside a customer manager; use the compiler's `_pseudo_groups` route
metadata for split/recombine.

When the YAML carries relationship metadata, expose it separately from workflow
metadata. A manager should be able to answer four different questions:

- What final JSON groups and fields exist?
- What workflow groups will GroundX execute?
- Where does each workflow field write in the final JSON?
- What final-group metadata controls dedupe, matching, conflict surfacing,
  passthrough, reconcile context, or QA context?

Do not derive those answers from group-name guesses. Reconcile and QA wrappers
that need relationship context should receive the final-shape fields and
final-group metadata explicitly.

## 4. Workflow Management Sequence

For a new prompt schema:

1. Compile the YAML into workflow JSON and
   `extraction_workflow_metadata_v1.json`.
   `workflow.json.extract` must come from the SDK persisted workflow extract
   mapping, not from an execution-only group dictionary.
2. Validate the workflow JSON shape.
3. Create the workflow.
4. Check the workflow by reading it back and confirming custom steps/routes are present.
5. Attach to the account default only if the pilot needs account-level default
   behavior.
6. Attach to the test bucket.
7. Ingest the test document.
8. Poll until complete.
9. Retrieve extract output.
10. Retrieve X-Ray output.
11. Reassemble workflow output into the final data object when route-map
    metadata is present.

For a prompt edit, use `update_prompts` rather than creating a new workflow.
Detach with `remove_from_id` or `remove_from_account` when a pilot should no
longer use the workflow.

## 5. Debug Loop

When output is wrong or empty, inspect evidence before rewriting prompts:

1. Check document status and confirm the ingest completed.
2. Retrieve `get_extract` and inspect the structured result.
3. Retrieve `get_xray` and inspect the source chunk evidence.
4. Compare the initial extraction result shape against the expected workflow
   shape and, after reassembly, the expected final output shape.
5. Use section summary, suggested text, and chunk evidence to decide whether the
   YAML field prompt, wrapper prompt, or downstream reconcile/QA prompt needs the
   change.

Only tighten the YAML or wrappers after that inspection. Re-ingest only when the
workflow prompt changed; use captured X-Ray for local comparison and debugging
when possible.

## 6. Migration To The Future Path

This today path is deliberately close to the future `groundx-python/extract`
direction:

- YAML stays durable.
- Prompt wrappers are thin and named by stage.
- Workflow lifecycle operations are centralized in one manager.
- Debug evidence is captured in a predictable shape.

As the SDK abstraction grows, the customer should be able to replace manager
glue with `groundx-python/extract` calls while keeping most of the YAML and
prompt-stage intent.
