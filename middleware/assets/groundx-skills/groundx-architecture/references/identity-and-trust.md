# Identity & Trust

GroundX's identity model is **intentionally narrow**: a single API-key header (`X-API-Key`) carries both customer-tier and partner-tier credentials; partner-on-behalf-of-customer requests add `X-Customer-Key`; Basic Auth is reserved for the partner-tier login / register flow that issues partner keys. No key rotation, no per-customer RBAC, no SSO. The trust boundary of the deployment is well-defined and crossed only by a small set of explicit configurations (3rd-party LLM, Google Cloud Vision OCR). This file documents the auth surfaces, the trust-boundary shape, and the things that are explicitly *not* part of the model — so downstream skills don't claim them.

## 1. Marketing altitude

Not the canonical place — auth and trust shape are buyer-level discussions, not marketing-level. The marketing-altitude story about security defers to deployment posture (`groundx-on-prem`) and `master-brand-gtm` / `product-brand-gtm` for the words.

## 2. Product altitude

GroundX authenticates API callers through a small set of header patterns:

- **Customer-tier** — the surface customers and customer-built applications use. `X-API-Key` set to the customer's key. Issued by the partner (via the partner API) and lives for the life of the account.
- **Partner-tier (partner account)** — partners, internal middleware, and the Studio Harness operating on their own partner account. `X-API-Key` set to the partner key; no `X-Customer-Key`.
- **Partner-tier (on behalf of a customer)** — partners operating *as* one of their managed customer accounts. `X-API-Key` set to the partner key; `X-Customer-Key` set to the target customer's key.
- **Basic Auth** — reserved for the partner-tier login / register / password-reset flow that exchanges username + password for a partner API key. Not used for ongoing API operations.

There is **no SSO, no OIDC, no SAML** at the customer-tier today. There is **no RBAC** inside a customer account — the `X-API-Key` is the entire customer-tier authentication surface. Query-time scoping (limiting a request to specific buckets, groups, or documents) is done via the API's filter parameters, not via a roles/users model.

## 3. Conceptual / algorithmic altitude

Three architectural ideas shape the identity model:

**Issue-once API keys, not rotation.** Customer API keys are issued once and live with the account. The system does not maintain a key-rotation mechanism. Operationally, this means a customer's key is its long-term identity — and a leaked key requires partner-side intervention (revocation + re-issue) rather than a rolling rotation flow.

**Single ingress; in-namespace trust beyond it.** All external API calls — customer-tier and partner-tier — enter through the `groundx` pod (per `overview.md` § 2). `groundx` authenticates the request and hands work off through the queue layer. Downstream pods do not re-authenticate; they are inherently trusted by virtue of living inside the same Kubernetes namespace. The namespace itself is the trust enclosure; auth lives at the external boundary.

**Backing-service-owned encryption-at-rest.** GroundX does not maintain a separate KMS or key-management layer. Encryption-at-rest is owned by the chosen backing services — RDS for MySQL, OpenSearch's own encryption, S3 SSE-KMS for file storage. Deployments inherit whatever encryption posture their `values.yaml` selections provide.

## 4. System altitude

The identity surfaces and where they're enforced:

```
external caller → groundx (auth check)  ───  customer X-API-Key (most calls)
                                        └──  partner/admin API key (Workspace facade, customer provisioning, customer-scoped operations via X-Customer-Key)

groundx → Redis (cached auth) → MySQL/RDS (auth of record)        on cache miss
                              → workspace-api (Workspace facade routing only; not externally reachable)
                              → queue layer → downstream pods (no re-auth)
```

For the full system topology see `overview.md` § 2. For the queue handoff after auth see `ingest-service.md` § 5.

## 5. Implementation altitude

### 5.1 Auth surfaces

| Pattern | Headers | Identity | Rotation | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer-tier | `X-API-Key: <customer key>` | Customer account | **None — issue once** | Customer applications; SDKs; customer-built frontends; the Studio Harness's customer-tier surfaces |
| Partner-tier (partner account) | `X-API-Key: <partner key>` | Partner account itself | Not specified at this altitude | Partner middleware operating on its own account; partner-account introspection |
| Partner-tier (on behalf of a customer) | `X-API-Key: <partner key>` + `X-Customer-Key: <customer key>` | Partner authenticated; acting as the named customer | (inherits from partner key) | Partner middleware operating on behalf of one of its managed customers |
| Workspace facade | `X-API-Key: <workspace-capable key>` | Partner/admin or workspace-enabled account | (inherits from account key) | Studio Harness managed-project operations via `groundx-api` Workspace endpoints |
| Basic Auth (login / register only) | `Authorization: Basic <user:pass>` | Partner credential exchange | n/a (credential flow) | Partner login, register, password reset — exchanges username + password for a partner API key. Not used for ongoing API operations. |

*Source: auth headers and the X-API-Key / X-Customer-Key composition pattern align with GroundX customer and partner API documentation. The "issue-once, no rotation" + "no customer-tier SSO/OIDC/SAML" framing is a scoped internal-review finding, 2026-05-17.*

### 5.2 Auth lookup path

`groundx` resolves auth on every request via the standard cached-then-DB pattern (per `store.md` § 5.2):

1. Check Redis for the cached auth record.
2. On cache miss, read from MySQL/RDS and populate Redis.

This applies to every API request — search included; it is not search-specific.

### 5.3 In-namespace trust (a feature, not a gap)

Once `groundx` authenticates a request, downstream pods receive the work through the queue layer and do not re-authenticate. They are inherently trusted because they live inside the same Kubernetes namespace as `groundx`. The Kubernetes namespace boundary is the trust enclosure; the authentication boundary is the `groundx` ingress at the external edge. This is what makes the **stateless-pod + queue-handoff** architecture clean to operate: pods don't carry credentials or replay auth checks on internal work.

### 5.4 What is NOT in the model

This list exists because downstream skills must not claim these:

- **No customer API key rotation.** Issue-once.
- **No RBAC inside a customer account.** `X-API-Key` is the entire customer-tier surface; per-call scope narrowing is done via the API's filter parameters.
- **No SSO / OIDC / SAML.** Not supported today at the customer tier.
- **No GroundX-managed KMS.** Encryption-at-rest is delegated to backing services.

### 5.5 Workspace runner ingress invariant

The workspace runner (`workspace-api` + 5 worker pods, per `workspace-architecture.md`) is reachable **only through `groundx` as the Workspace facade**. There is no direct external path. This is an architectural invariant.

## 6. Security / compliance altitude

### 6.1 Audit logging

The `groundx` pod emits a raw log that catalogs every API action. **This is the only comprehensive audit log GroundX maintains.** Everything else — store-level logs, queue-level logs, downstream-pod logs — is whatever the backing services and pod runtimes emit natively. For the broader observability framing see `observability.md`.

### 6.2 Trust boundary

The default deployment is **closed** — document content and customer data do not leave the deployment's trust boundary on the ingest, search, or extraction paths. Two configurations cross the boundary:

| Crossing | Triggered by | What leaves the deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd-party LLM call | `summary.serviceType` set to a hosted engine (`openai`, `azure`, `openai-base64`, `deep-infra`, `eyelevel` pointed at a hosted endpoint) | Document content during the agentic pipeline's LLM calls (per `summary-service.md` § 6 + `agentic-pipeline.md` § 6) |
| Google Cloud Vision OCR | `gcv.json` GCP service account file provided | Page images on every OCR call (per `layout-ocr.md` § 6) |

The bundled-self-hosted summary stack and the customer-hosted-LLM mode both keep document content inside the deployment's trust boundary. The hybrid-search path is **entirely in-cluster** regardless of which summary mode is in use during ingest (per `hybrid-search.md` § 6).

### 6.3 Blast radius of compromised credentials

| Credential leaked | Attacker can |
| --- | --- |
| Customer `X-API-Key` | Read and write everything in that single customer account |
| Partner Basic Auth | Read AND write **everything in every customer account** the partner manages, plus Partner lifecycle/provisioning operations |
| Workspace-capable key | Run managed-project Workspace facade operations exposed through `groundx-api` when the account has that capability |

There is no scope-narrowing inside the partner-tier — a leaked partner key has full blast radius across all customers the partner provisions.

### 6.4 Encryption-at-rest

Delegated to the backing services per `values.yaml`:

- MySQL/RDS — backing-service encryption (RDS encryption-at-rest, or the equivalent for self-hosted MySQL).
- OpenSearch — OpenSearch's own encryption.
- File storage (MinIO/S3) — S3 SSE-KMS or MinIO's encryption configuration.

GroundX does not maintain a separate KMS layer. Compliance-sensitive deployments inherit whatever the chosen backings provide.

### 6.5 API Security Posture

Use this for security reviews, architecture answers, implementation planning, and vendor-risk questionnaires. Keep cloud and on-prem distinct, and do not turn deployment-layer options into native GroundX API-auth claims.

| Topic | Cloud posture | On-prem posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport security and mTLS | GroundX Cloud APIs are served over HTTPS/TLS 1.2 through AWS API Gateway. Mutual TLS is not currently native to the public `api.groundx.ai` REST API. | GroundX supports ingress TLS, backing-service TLS, and optional in-cluster TLS through Kubernetes secrets. Mutual TLS can be enforced by the customer's ingress, service mesh, or API gateway if required. |
| Authentication model and OAuth/JWT boundary | GroundX REST API authentication uses `X-API-Key`, not OAuth 2.0/JWT. OAuth is used for the hosted MCP connector flow, where supported clients authorize access without placing API keys in prompts. | The GroundX application API uses the same API-key model. OAuth/JWT can be added in front of GroundX by a customer-controlled gateway or identity proxy, but it is not the native GroundX API auth model. |
| Additional API protections | GroundX enforces API-key authentication, authenticated ownership checks, bucket access checks, request/body validation, ingest file/page/batch limits, subscription/search usage limits, and API action logging. The public API is also fronted by AWS API Gateway; do not claim native step-up auth, content filtering, behavior analysis, or per-customer search-rate limiting unless separately configured. | The same application-level controls apply: API-key auth, ownership/bucket checks, request validation, ingest limits, usage controls where configured, and audit logging. WAF, mTLS, behavior analysis, API attack blocking, and additional rate limiting are normally enforced by the customer's ingress, service mesh, API gateway, or security platform. |

## 7. Operations / SRE altitude

Auth lookups hit the Redis cache for most requests; cache misses fall through to MySQL/RDS. A surge in cache misses (e.g., after a Redis restart) increases MySQL/RDS load. For the broader observability framing see `observability.md`. For the auth-lookup pattern see `store.md` § 5.2.

## 8. Data architecture altitude

Auth state lives in the **Process Metadata DB** (MySQL/RDS for durable rows; Redis for cached hot records). Per-customer isolation enforcement at the data-store level — how customer rows / indices / file prefixes are kept separate — is documented in `multi-tenancy.md`. The audit log emitted by `groundx` is the canonical record of authenticated API actions; per `observability.md` for storage and retention specifics.

## 9. Cost / FinOps altitude

Identity and trust are not significant cost drivers at this altitude — the auth path is a Redis hit on the cached case and a small MySQL/RDS lookup on the miss case. The cost implications of trust-boundary choices (3rd-party LLM vs bundled self-hosted, Tesseract vs GCV) live with the respective subsystems (`summary-service.md` § 9, `layout-ocr.md` § 9).

- **The partner API surface and customer lifecycle operations** (registration, login, password reset, profile lookup, customer key provisioning): partner API documentation.
- **The customer-tier API surface and filter parameters** (the scope-narrowing mechanism inside a customer account): `groundx-api`.
