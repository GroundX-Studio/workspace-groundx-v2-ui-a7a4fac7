/**
 * Extract — LLM tool declarations
 * (2026-05-30-onboarding-shell-shared-view Phase 3a).
 *
 * The canvas-dispatch tool for the extraction workbench (frame f3). Per the
 * agent-tools spec, `show_` is the canonical canvas-dispatch verb for every
 * ScopedViewerWidget (already allowlisted in `check-tool-quality`). This is
 * the FIRST extract canvas-dispatch tool — it mirrors `show_smart_report_render`:
 * a `read`-category navigation tool that MOVES the canvas to the extraction
 * workbench for a scope.
 *
 * Round-trip: the LLM emits `show_extraction` → middleware validates +
 * invokes the `intentBuilder` → result is a `showExtract` `CanvasIntent` →
 * the orchestrator's built-in handler routes to `advanceFrame("f3")` (the
 * SAME canvas move the Extract step-strip sub-pill performs) → `<ScopedCanvas>`
 * mounts the Extract workbench for the `extract-workbench` step.
