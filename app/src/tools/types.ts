 * (`toolsForStep`, `chatRouter.ts`), and the app dispatches server-built
 * `reply.intents`. Recommendation: DELETE this app-side registry + the dead
 * `category`/`handler` duplication of the server `intentBuilder`. The delete
 * is DEFERRED — `toolRegistry` is shared by four in-flight changes (RCC,
 * core-data, widget-role-access, wf04) and a half-done removal across them is
 * forbidden (cross-plan conflict map). A coordinated follow-up owns the
