# Tasks — core data-model hardening: remaining refactors

> Every item is tracked here so none reverts to a silent placeholder/hack. Each lands behind green
> tests, no user-visible regression. WIP cap = 3 in flight. TDD: failing test first, then implement,
> then adversarial review before marking done.
>
> **Authoring order rule:** the recurrence drift-guards (§5) are authored AFTER the bases they guard
> exist (a `*Error`-base guard presupposes the `ApiError` base; a placeholder guard presupposes the
> typed contexts). §6 (the DB drop) is SOAK-GATED — not ready until a release after the `templates`
> migration; it stays an open ticket, never advanced past gated.

## 1. Split chatRouter.ts
**Execution: → SEQUENTIAL.** Behavior-preserving refactor of a single 1637-line file — cannot be
safely parallelized. One hand, tests green after each extraction.

- [x] **Failing/guard test:** lock the public surface of `chatRouter.ts` (exported entry points +
  observable behavior) with the existing `chatRouter.test.ts` suite green as the regression baseline
  BEFORE moving any code. — DONE: new `chatRouter.split.test.ts` asserts each sub-module exists +
  `chatRouter.ts` re-exports the SAME bindings (`===` identity); failed red before extraction (modules
  absent), green after. Existing `chatRouter.test.ts` (90 tests) kept unchanged as the behavior baseline.
- [x] Extract the **wire types** into their own module; re-export from `chatRouter.ts`. tsc + tests green.
  — DONE: `chatRouterTypes.ts` (request/response/debug/deps types, `proposalEnvelopeV1Schema`,
  `ChatRouteNotImplementedError`, `GroundXSearchResult`, shared tuning constants).
- [x] Extract the **deterministic classifier** into its own module. tsc + tests green. — DONE:
  `chatClassifier.ts` (`classifyChatMode`).
- [x] Extract **`searchGroundX` + `composeFilters`** into their own module. tsc + tests green. — DONE:
  `groundxSearch.ts` (`searchGroundX`, `composeFilters`, `SearchGroundXOptions`).
- [x] Extract the **RAG pipeline** (`runRagPipeline`/`callGroundedLlm`/`parseGroundedAnswer`/
  `buildSnippetBlock`) into its own module. tsc + tests green. — DONE: `ragPipeline.ts`. Live seams
  preserved verbatim: server-side role filter (`toolsForStep(activeStepKind, callerRole)`), word-level
  `assignTier(v, { hasAtomBox })` + `wordMapFetch`, inline `ContentScope` derivation.
- [x] Extract the **mocks** into their own module. tsc + tests green. — DONE: `chatMocks.ts`
  (`mockResponseFor` + per-scenario fixtures).
- [x] Adversarial review: `chatRouter.ts` is now a thin composition; no behavior change; full
  middleware suite + app suite green. — DONE: `chatRouter.ts` 1698→150 lines (entry `routeChat` +
  re-export barrel). Verified no test weakened/retargeted (chatRouter.test.ts 90 / chatHandler.test.ts 36
  / structuredHandler.test.ts 27 all unchanged + green); middleware suite 649 green, app suite 1414 green,
  middleware tsc clean, app `npm run build` (tsc+vite) clean, `openspec validate --strict` clean.

## 2. Shared ApiError base + 7-error refactor
**Execution: ◑ MIXED.** Author the base `ApiError` SEQUENTIAL (the contract). Refactoring the 7
hand-rolled errors onto it is ⟲ WORKFLOW-OK once the base lands — each error in its own file,
independent, against a fixed base.

- [x] **Failing test:** assert a base `ApiError extends Error` exists with `status` + `detail`, and
  that an instance is `instanceof Error` + `instanceof ApiError`. — DONE: new
  `middleware/src/services/apiError.test.ts` asserts the base shape + that each middleware `*Error` is
  `instanceof ApiError` + preserves its observable envelope (`.statusCode`/`.status`/`.upstreamStatus`/
  `.mode`). Failed red (ApiError absent), green after.
- [x] Introduce the base `ApiError extends Error` (`status`, `detail`). — DONE: added to
  `@groundx/shared` (`shared/src/index.ts`) — isomorphic plain class, `readonly status`/`detail`,
  `detail` optional, `Object.setPrototypeOf(this, new.target.prototype)` so `instanceof` survives.
- [x] Refactor app errors onto it: `ExtractFieldApiError`, `TemplateApiError`, `ChatApiError`,
  `SmartReportApiError`. — DONE: all four now `extends ApiError`, call `super(message, status, detail)`,
  set only `this.name`; their own `status`/`detail` field declarations removed. (`SmartReportApiError`
  in `app/src/api/smartReport.ts` was missed in the first pass — it predates §2, created by the archived
  `2026-05-29-smart-report-screen` change — and swept here: new `instanceof ApiError` test in
  `smartReport.test.ts` failed red, then green after the refactor; its live consumer
  `SmartReportBuilder.tsx:257` reads `.status` unchanged.) Existing error-path tests unchanged + green.
- [x] Refactor middleware errors onto it: `ChatHandlerError`, `ChatRouteNotImplementedError`,
  `UpstreamHttpError`, `UpstreamTimeoutError`. — DONE: all four `extends ApiError`. `ChatHandlerError`
  keeps `.statusCode` as a getter aliasing base `.status` (route reads it). `ChatRouteNotImplementedError`
  passes `status:501`, keeps `.mode`. Upstream errors pass `status` to super, keep `.upstreamStatus`
  (mirror) for the global handler payload. Envelope unchanged.
- [x] Adversarial review: every `*Error` extends the base; no error class declares its own `status`/
  `detail` fields; suites green both sides. — DONE (re-verified after the SmartReportApiError sweep):
  all 8 hand-rolled errors extend `ApiError` with real non-test throw-sites — app: ExtractFieldApiError,
  TemplateApiError, ChatApiError, SmartReportApiError (smartReport.ts:159 & :236, consumed at
  SmartReportBuilder.tsx:257); middleware: ChatHandlerError×9, NotImplemented×1, UpstreamHttp via
  `upstreamError()` helper w/ 2 callers, UpstreamTimeout×1 — none dormant. CORRECTION to the prior note:
  an earlier completion claim asserted "only the base declares status/detail fields" — that was FALSE.
  `grep -rn '^\s*status:' app/src/api/*.ts` had surfaced `smartReport.ts:36` (`status: number;`) and
  `detail:` at `:37` — real class-field declarations on a then-`extends Error` subclass, not ctor
  params/getters. Those fields are now removed (the class extends `ApiError` and defers to `super`), so the
  acceptance criterion "no error class declares its own status/detail fields" now holds across the codebase.
  Re-ran: middleware 653 + app 1414+ suites green (error-path tests unchanged, not retargeted); middleware
  tsc clean; app `npm run build` (tsc+vite) clean; `openspec validate --strict` clean.

## 3. Entity CRUD factory + 8-context factory + SdkActionResult union
**Execution: ◑ MIXED.** Author `SdkActionResult<T>`, `createEntityClient<T>()`, `createEntityContext<T>()`
SEQUENTIAL (the factory contracts). Migrating the ~30 `api/entities/*` wrappers + the 8 contexts onto
them is ⟲ WORKFLOW-OK once the factories land — independent per file, fixed factory.

- [x] **Failing test:** the `{ isSuccess: false; response: null; error: null }` limbo no longer
  type-checks; an `isSuccess:true` value exposes `response` and an `isSuccess:false` value exposes
  `error` (discriminated-union narrowing). — DONE: new `contexts/sdkContextTypes.test.ts` — two
  `@ts-expect-error` cases (the `{isSuccess:false;response:null;error:null}` limbo + a success with
  `response:null`) plus runtime narrowing asserts. Failed red first (`sdkSuccess`/`sdkFailure` absent),
  green after. The `@ts-expect-error` cases are load-bearing under `npm run build` (tsc): if the limbo
  ever re-typechecked, tsc flags the directive UNUSED and the build fails.
- [x] Define `SdkActionResult<T>` as a discriminated union
  (`{isSuccess:true;response:T} | {isSuccess:false;error}`). — DONE: `contexts/sdkContextTypes.ts` now
  `type SdkActionResult<T> = {isSuccess:true; response:T; error?:undefined} | {isSuccess:false;
  response:null; error:NonNullable<unknown>}`. Failure keeps `response:null` so the many callers that
  read `result.response` without narrowing (Extract.tsx, useLiveExtractionSchema, PdfViewerWidget,
  AppInitialization) still compile, AND the existing context failure-path tests that assert
  `toMatchObject({isSuccess:false, response:null})` stay green unchanged. The old mutable
  `createSdkResult()` builder (which produced the limbo) is REPLACED by `sdkSuccess(response)` /
  `sdkFailure(error)` constructors — zero `createSdkResult` references remain.
- [~] Author `createEntityClient<T>()` (api) over `SdkActionResult<T>`. — DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT
  (earn-every-axis GUARDRAIL, project_anti_overengineering). The ~30 `api/entities/*` wrappers do NOT
  share an `SdkActionResult` shape — they are 4-7-line thin axios calls returning RAW response bodies
  (`BucketResponse`/`GroupResponse`/`MessageResponse`/…). Their only common core is
  `(await axios.<verb>(url, ...args)).data`; they vary on EVERY other axis (verb · url-template ·
  request body · response-unwrap key · groundx-vs-partner config builder · pagination · path-encoding)
  and many carry genuinely-bespoke methods (`addBucketToGroundXGroup`, `attachBucketToPartnerProject`,
  `customerEntity` x-jwt-token header extraction, `documentsEntity` ingest/crawl/copy). A
  `createEntityClient<T>()` generating uniform list/create/get/update/delete would need per-method
  config objects LONGER than the current one-liners and could not cover the bespoke methods — a forced
  abstraction with awkward escape hatches, the exact pattern the GUARDRAIL forbids. Kept the concrete
  wrappers; noted here rather than orphaning a one-true-shape abstraction.
- [x] Author `createEntityContext<T>()` (context) over `SdkActionResult<T>`. — DONE:
  `contexts/createEntityContext.tsx` exports (1) `useSdkRunner(defaultErrorMessage)` — the context-side
  runner that BUILDS an `SdkActionResult<T>` (so the limbo can't be hand-constructed at a call-site),
  replacing the byte-identical `run = useCallback(...)` helper that lived in 6 providers + the inlined
  twins in Search/Health; (2) `createContextHook(Context, msg)` — replacing the duplicated
  `useContext; if(!c) throw; return c;` hook body in 8 context `index.tsx` files. Both factories have
  ≥6 real consumers (axis earned). New `contexts/createEntityContext.test.tsx` (failing-first) covers
  success/failure/override + in-provider/out-of-provider.
- [~] Migrate the ~30 `api/entities/*` CRUD wrappers (list/create/get/update/delete) onto
  `createEntityClient<T>()`. ⟲ per-wrapper. — N/A: `createEntityClient<T>()` deliberately not built
  (see above). The concrete wrappers are unchanged and remain the source of truth; `entityCoverage.test.ts`
  (15) stays green.
- [x] Migrate the 8 hand-rolled CRUD contexts (Buckets/Documents/Groups/Projects/Workflows/ApiKeys/
  Search/Health) onto `createEntityContext<T>()`. ⟲ per-context. — DONE: all 8 providers now call
  `useSdkRunner("<entity> operation failed.")` instead of an inline `run`; Search/Health rewrote their
  inlined variants onto the runner (state-setting stays inside the `work` closure); all 8 `index.tsx`
  hooks now `createContextHook(...)` with byte-identical error messages. Existing `sdkContexts.test.tsx`
  (14) + the 6 per-provider `*Provider.test.tsx` suites stay green; only an INCIDENTAL `let
  actionResult: {isSuccess:boolean; error:unknown}` annotation in the 6 failure-path tests was widened
  to `{isSuccess:boolean; response?:unknown; error?:unknown}` to match the union (assertions untouched,
  not a retarget). NOTE on `run` signature: the old Buckets `run(work, errorMessage, successMessage)`
  arg order is unified to the runner's `(work, successMessage?, errorMessage?)`; the 6 Bucket call-sites
  that passed the redundant default error string were rewritten to pass only the success message —
  behavior identical (the explicit string equalled the default).
- [x] Route `AuthProvider`'s `{isSuccess, error}` two-boolean twin through `SdkActionResult<T>`. — DONE:
  `register`/`resetPassword`/`confirmChangingPassword`/`updateAppMetadata` now return
  `SdkActionResult<void>` and `getUserData` returns `SdkActionResult<User>`, built via
  `sdkSuccess`/`sdkFailure` (`AuthContext.tsx` interface + `AuthProvider.tsx` bodies). `login` keeps its
  distinct `LoginReqCallback` (has `banned`) — not a simple twin, left alone. This ELIMINATES the
  hand-rolled limbo in `register` (old code returned `{isSuccess:false, error:false}` when
  `api.register` returned falsy). Consumers verified behavior-preserving: Register.tsx (`if
  result.isSuccess`), ResetPassword.tsx (×2), OnboardingProvider (`if result.isSuccess`),
  AppInitialization (`if result.error || !result.response`). Their test mocks were updated to emit
  `SdkActionResult` values (`sdkSuccess`/`sdkFailure`) — AppInitialization.test, Home.test,
  OnboardingProvider.test — assertions unchanged.
- [x] Adversarial review: no hand-rolled CRUD wrapper/context remains off the factory; the limbo state
  is unrepresentable; app suite green. — DONE: zero `createSdkResult` references remain; zero inline
  `run = useCallback` helpers remain across the 8 contexts; all 8 `useXContext` hooks go through
  `createContextHook`; the `{isSuccess:false;response:null;error:null}` limbo + the hand-rolled
  `{isSuccess:false,error:false}` limbo in AuthProvider are both unrepresentable (tsc-enforced). EARNED:
  `SdkActionResult` (8 contexts + Auth + external readers), `useSdkRunner` (8 providers), `createContextHook`
  (8 hooks) — each ≥2 real consumers; `createEntityClient` deliberately not built (forced-abstraction
  guardrail, documented above). Gates: app suite 1424 green (existing tests unchanged, not retargeted),
  middleware suite 653 green (untouched), app `npm run build` (tsc+vite) clean, `openspec validate
  --strict` clean, widget-contract (164) + no-hardcoded-styles (72) + entityCoverage (15) guards green.

## 4. Type-unification + row-mapper validation + wire-types module + illegal-states unions

### 4a. Type-unification (⟲ WORKFLOW-OK once the target type is confirmed; drift guard stays green)
- [x] **#12 field-type union → shared.** Failing test: a type-equality assert each former alias ===
  `TemplateFieldType`. Replace ~10 re-spellings of `"STRING"|"NUMBER"|"DATE"|"BOOLEAN"` (`api/
  extractField.ts`, `services/fieldExtractor.ts`, + 8 inline) with `TemplateFieldType` from
  `@groundx/shared`.
  — DONE: the two exported named aliases are now thin re-exports of the shared union —
  `ExtractFieldType = TemplateFieldType` (`app/src/api/extractField.ts`) and
  `SchemaFieldType = TemplateFieldType` (`middleware/src/services/fieldExtractor.ts`) — so their
  consumers keep the local name while the literal union lives ONCE in `@groundx/shared`. The 6 inline
  type-position re-spellings folded onto `TemplateFieldType`: app `types/scenarios.ts` (`SchemaFieldDef`),
  `api/chatSessions.ts` (`ProposedSchemaField`), `contexts/ChatStoreContext/types.ts` ×3
  (`SchemaFieldAddition`/`SchemaFieldEdit`/`SchemaFieldProposal`), `contexts/CanvasOrchestratorContext/
  types.ts` (`proposeSchemaField` intent arm); middleware `scenarios/types.ts` (`SchemaFieldDef`) +
  `services/chatRouterTypes.ts` (`ProposedSchemaField`). Failing-first compile-time `Eq` assert in
  `app/src/api/extractField.test.ts` (`_assertFieldType`) + a runtime check that
  `templateFieldTypeSchema.options` equals the 4 values. ZERO type-position `"STRING"|…` re-spellings
  remain (verified by grep). REMAINING (separate axis, NOT folded): the `z.enum(["STRING",…])` RUNTIME
  validators in the tools files + `app.ts` `validTypes` Set — those are validators that should derive
  from `templateFieldTypeSchema`, but folding them changes runtime validation wiring (behavior-adjacent),
  tracked as a follow-up, not type duplication. App `npm run build` (tsc+vite) + middleware tsc clean.
- [x] **#13 `ExtractFieldResult` → shared** (the `/api/extract-field` body twin) + fold the 3rd
  `SuggestedAction` copy (`SuggestedActionChips.tsx`) onto the shared type with the chatSessions↔
  chatRouter pair.
  — DONE (both halves; the SuggestedAction fold closed the open half in step 2-7g). The byte-identical
  `ExtractFieldResult` interface declared on BOTH sides of the wire (app `api/extractField.ts` + middleware
  `services/fieldExtractor.ts`) is ONE shared shape: `extractFieldResultSchema` / `ExtractFieldResult` in
  `@groundx/shared` (with `extractFieldCitationSchema` for the `{documentId,page,snippet?}` citation subset).
  Both sides import + re-export it; the two local interface declarations are deleted. **SuggestedAction
  fold (step 2-7g):** the THREE byte-identical `{key,label,detail?}` copies (`SuggestedActionChips.tsx`
  `SuggestedAction`, `chatSessions.ChatSuggestedAction`, middleware `chatRouterTypes.SuggestedAction`) are
  now ONE `suggestedActionSchema`/`SuggestedAction` in `@groundx/shared`; all three re-export it (the widget
  + `ChatSuggestedAction` alias + the middleware re-export) so consumers keep their local names. Real
  consumers per side: SuggestedActionChips widget, `useConversation`/`chatPrimitives`/`ChatReply` (app),
  `chatRouter`/`ragPipeline` (middleware) — axis earned. Failing-first: a runtime `suggestedActionSchema`
  validate + a compile-time `Eq<SuggestedAction, SharedSuggestedAction>` assert in
  `SuggestedActionChips.test.tsx` (red — schema absent; green after). App + middleware suites green.

### 4b. Wire-types module + description-level drift guard (◑ MIXED — fold per twin, guard green)
- [ ] **#18 shared wire-types module.** Move onto `@groundx/shared` `z.infer`: the `/api/chat/*`
  envelope (`ChatReply`/`ChatReplyDebug`/`ChatDispatchedIntent`/`ChatToolFailure` ↔ `ChatRouterResponse`/…,
  inline `_debug.scope`, `CreateChatSessionResult`, `scopeHint`), `AppUserMetadata`, the 7× `eventSource`
  enum (vs `IntentSource`), the WF-03 page-dim shape, `SchemaFieldExtractionResult`, the two customer-auth
  client modules.
  — PARTIAL (step 2-7g — the proposal-envelope twin pair folded + the **wire-twin drift-guard mechanism
  established and proven to fire**; the larger envelope/metadata/enum list left open → checkbox stays `[ ]`).
  Folded `ProposedSchemaField` + `ProposalEnvelopeProvenance` onto `@groundx/shared`
  (`proposedSchemaFieldSchema`/`proposalEnvelopeProvenanceSchema`) — these were declared on BOTH sides AND
  had silently DRIFTED (app `provenance?` optional vs middleware `provenance` required); unified OPTIONAL
  (middleware only ever WRITES a present value, app readers already guard `provenance?.verified` — zero
  behavior change). Both sides re-export. **Drift guard:** a compile-time `Eq<ProposedSchemaField(app),
  SharedProposedSchemaField>` + `Eq<…Provenance…>` in `chatSessions.test.ts` — load-bearing under app
  `npm run build` (tsc includes `src/**/*`); VERIFIED it fires by forking the app type (got
  `TS2344: Type 'false' does not satisfy the constraint 'true'`), then reverted. Failing-first: a runtime
  `proposedSchemaFieldSchema` validate (red — absent; green after). NOT DONE (deferred, genuinely larger):
  the `ChatReply`/`ChatRouterResponse` envelope fold, `AppUserMetadata`, the `eventSource`/`IntentSource`
  enum, the WF-03 page-dim shape, `SchemaFieldExtractionResult`, the customer-auth modules — each threads
  through many readers and is a multi-step fold of its own; left honestly open rather than half-wired.
- [ ] **LOW — fold remaining inline wire-twins** onto the shared module: ~~`ProposalEnvelopeProvenance`
  (declared twice)~~ — DONE in step 2-7g (folded with #18 above; both declarations replaced by a
  `@groundx/shared` re-export, the twin can no longer drift). Still open: the debug-scope twin
  (`ChatRouterDebug.scope` ↔ `ChatReplyDebug.scope` → derive from shared `ContentScope`), the X-Ray
  response shape (declared 3× with `documentPages[].number` vs `.page` drift — coordinate with `wf05b`, do
  not double-fix), and one shared `Source` union (`IntentSource = Exclude<Source,'system'>`).
- [x] **Upgrade the tool-catalog drift guard** from name-set to NAME+DESCRIPTION parity app↔server
  (`toolCatalog.test.ts` — currently 6/8 descriptions drifted). Failing-first.
  — DONE: the description-parity assertion landed in the EXISTING cross-package consumer
  `app/src/tools/catalog-parity.test.ts` (it already imports BOTH catalogs — the app `toolRegistry`
  glob + the middleware `SERVER_TOOL_CATALOG`; `toolCatalog.test.ts` can't see the app glob, so the
  cross-package guard is the only place a real app↔server description comparison can run). New test
  "every app tool's description matches its server mirror's description verbatim" failed RED first
  (9 drifted descriptions — book_call, commit_gate, dismiss_gate, propose_schema_field, accept_proposal,
  reject_proposal, accept_report_section, reject_report_section, edit_report_section — wording diverged
  silently between the hand-mirrored sides), green after reconciling the 9 SERVER descriptions to match
  the app `.tools.ts` canonical text VERBATIM. Behavior-preserving: descriptions are LLM-facing text; the
  edit only de-drifts wording (no tool/intent/schema change). The guard now fires on any future one-sided
  description edit. SERVER-ONLY tools (suggest_intent) skipped by design. Existing `toolCatalog.test.ts`
  (18) unchanged + green; tool-quality/tool-references guards green (descriptions still pass the 40-char +
  Use-when floor).

### 4c. Row-mapper validation (→ SEQUENTIAL/TDD)
- [x] **Union-typed DB columns get validation in the row→object mappers.** Failing test: a corrupt
  `role`/`action`/`source`/`intent_kind`/`last_frame`/`entity_key` row value is rejected/coerced, not
  cast straight into LLM context. Push the citation-style validation into `rowToChatMessage`/
  `rowToViewerEvent` etc. (`mysqlRepository.ts`).
  — DONE: the three genuinely-union columns (`chat_messages.role`, `viewer_events.action`/`source`,
  `intent_log.source`) are now Zod-derived enums in `middleware/src/types.ts` (one source of truth — the
  TS type is `z.infer` of the schema, paralleling shared's `templateKindSchema`), and the row→object
  mappers narrow them via a new `coerceEnum(schema, value, fallback)` helper in `mysqlRepository.ts`
  (parallel to the existing `rowToTemplate` kind-guard precedent). A corrupt value is COERCED to a
  documented safe in-union default (`role`→`system`, `action`→`opened`, `source`→`system`) rather than
  blind-cast into LLM context — coerce-not-drop preserves turn ordering + the row's other fields. A VALID
  value passes through unchanged (behavior preserved). `intent_kind`/`last_frame`/`entity_key` are FREE
  strings (not closed unions — `intentKind` is the open CanvasIntent discriminator, `lastFrame`/`entityKey`
  are arbitrary ids), so they are correctly NOT enum-coerced. Failing-first: 5 new cases in
  `mysqlRepository.test.ts` ("row-mapper union validation (§4c)") — 3 corrupt-coercion (red first, green
  after) + 2 valid-passthrough (green throughout, proving behavior preserved). The MEDIUM `canvasIntentSchema`
  sub-item below is SEPARATE and remains open.
- [ ] **MEDIUM — promote a single `canvasIntentSchema` (Zod) to `@groundx/shared`** and validate at both
  boundaries that read `current_intent_json` (app ChatStore hydration `coerceHydratedIntent` structural
  guard + the middleware cast). Failing-first.

### 4d. dispatch() exhaustiveness + selector + illegal-states (→ SEQUENTIAL/TDD)
- [x] **#14 orchestrator `dispatch()` conforms to `app-architecture/spec.md`.** Failing test: a new
  `CanvasIntent` kind without a handler fails type-check (today the if-chain silently no-ops). Replace
  the 9-branch if-chain with one `switch (intent.kind)` + `const _never: never = intent`; delete the
  retired-but-live `registerAdapter` (zero non-test callers).
  — DONE: the three independent `if (intent.kind === …)` blocks in
  `CanvasOrchestratorContext.tsx` are now ONE `switch (intent.kind)` whose `default` calls the new
  exported `assertNeverIntent(intent: never): never` sentinel — a new union kind without a `case` now
  FAILS `tsc` (verified: a synthetic `__synthetic_unhandled__` kind triggers
  `TS2345: … not assignable to parameter of type 'never'` at the `assertNeverIntent(intent)` line, NOT a
  silent no-op). Behavior-preserving: every case keeps its exact prior context guard (`if (chatStore)` /
  `if (onboardingSession)` / `typeof window`) + handler; the ChatStore triple-write
  (`setCurrentIntent`/`appendViewerEvent`/`recordIntent`) stays a pre-switch block; the
  `adaptersRef.get(intent.kind)` dispatch runs after the switch unchanged. Failing-first test:
  `dispatchExhaustive.test.ts` (red first — `assertNeverIntent` absent; green after) + a `@ts-expect-error`
  proving the sentinel rejects a concrete kind. Existing `CanvasOrchestratorContext.test.tsx` (33) UNCHANGED
  + green. **CORRECTION to the stale task text + the change's spec delta:** `registerAdapter` is NOT
  "retired-but-live (zero non-test callers)" — it has 6 REAL non-test callers (SignUpWidget×1,
  DialogTitle×1, OnboardingWizard×4) added by `2026-05-31-tool-system-completion`. It is RETAINED (deleting
  it would break those widgets); the adapter-only kinds are enumerated as explicit no-op `case`s so the
  exhaustiveness check still names them. The change's `specs/app-architecture/spec.md` delta was reconciled
  to drop the false "SHALL be removed" clause.
- [x] **#16 `selectActiveStep(session)` selector** (co-located with ChatStore/viewer state) replaces the
  `stepIndex >= 0 ? history[stepIndex] : null` idiom at the 9 sites.
  — DONE: new `app/src/contexts/ChatStoreContext/selectors.ts` exports
  `selectActiveStep(session): ViewerStep | null` (typed against the minimal `{ viewer }` shape so it
  composes with any session-like value + tolerates null/undefined), exported from the context barrel.
  Replaced the verbatim inline idiom at the FOUR real sites that carried it (the grep found 4, not 9 —
  task text was an estimate): `views/Steady/SteadyShell` (`activeStep`),
  `views/Onboarding/OnboardingShell` ×2 (`latestViewerStepEarly` + `latestViewerStep`),
  `views/Onboarding/IngestView` (`latestStep`). Failing-first `selectors.test.ts` (red — module absent;
  green after) covers null/undefined session, empty viewer (stepIndex -1 → null), and index 0/1
  resolution. Behavior-preserving: the selector's `history[idx] ?? null` is falsy-equivalent to the old
  `history[idx]` at every consumer (each guards `step && step.kind === …`); app build (tsc+vite) clean,
  confirming no type regression. ZERO inline `currentStep.stepIndex >= 0` idioms remain (grep).
- [ ] **#20 illegal-states.** Session auth → `{kind:"anon"} | {kind:"authed";groundxUsername;
  groundxApiKey}`, collapse the ~12 empty-string `groundxUsername` checks; `LoginReqCallback` +
  `SchemaFieldExtractionResult` flat-record→discriminated union; add a `parseChatStoreSnapshot(unknown)`
  validator on the localStorage rehydration. Failing-first per shape.
  — PARTIAL (step 2-7g — the **session-auth union DONE** with the full reader migration; the
  `LoginReqCallback`/`SchemaFieldExtractionResult`/`parseChatStoreSnapshot` sub-shapes left open → checkbox
  stays `[ ]`). `middleware/src/middleware/session.ts` now models the in-memory request session as
  `SessionContext = AnonSession | AuthedSession` (`{id;kind:"anon"} | {id;kind:"authed";groundxUsername;
  groundxApiKey?}`) — the anon arm carries NO `groundxUsername` field, so the empty-string sentinel is
  UNREPRESENTABLE. `sessionMiddleware` is the ONE conversion boundary (DB `SessionRecord` string column →
  union; `""` → anon). The persistence `SessionRecord` (DB row shape) intentionally keeps the string column
  (a DB-schema change is out of scope). Added accessors `isAuthedSession`/`sessionUsername`/`sessionApiKey`
  (each ≥2 real consumers — axis earned) and migrated ALL ~16 readers: `requireAuthenticatedUser`
  (`kind !== "authed"`), `assertChatSessionOwnership` (`kind === "authed"`), `app.ts` auth/me · me/metadata ·
  onboarding/session `anonymous` flag · chat-sessions create (`ownerUserId`/`ownerAnonId`) · claim ·
  list-sessions · POST templates · POST report-render · the 3 `groundxApiKey ?? env` fallbacks · the
  customer-scoped-header `customerKey`. ZERO empty-string-sentinel readers remain (the surviving
  `if (!groundxUsername)` sites read the `string|null` HELPER return or the `ChatSessionRecord.ownerUserId`
  dep — NOT the session object). Behavior-preserving: every reader keeps its exact prior outcome. Tests:
  new `session.test.ts` union block (`isAuthedSession`/`sessionUsername` + `"groundxUsername" in anon` ===
  false), 4 existing session/ownership FIXTURES re-shaped to the union (assertions unchanged), failing-first
  (red before the helpers/union existed). Middleware suite 668 green, tsc clean. NOT DONE:
  `LoginReqCallback`/`SchemaFieldExtractionResult` flat→union + the `parseChatStoreSnapshot` localStorage
  validator — separate shapes, deferred honestly.
- [x] **#19 `assertChatSessionOwnership(session, req)` helper.** Failing test: all session routes return
  the SAME error code for a non-owner. Collapse the 6-way copy-pasted guard + reconcile the drifted twin
  (returns `chat_session_forbidden` not `not_session_owner`) onto one helper + one error code.
  — DONE: new `middleware/src/middleware/sessionOwnership.ts` exports
  `assertChatSessionOwnership(row, session): boolean` + the single `SESSION_NOT_OWNER_ERROR =
  "not_session_owner"` code. The helper keys ownership off the session's auth state — authed →
  `ownerUserId === groundxUsername`, anon → `ownerAnonId === session.id` (the dominant 6-site semantics;
  the two arms are mutually exclusive so a stale anon owner can't grant an authed session access). Wired
  into ALL SEVEN guards in `app.ts`: the 6 that already returned `not_session_owner` (PATCH session,
  PATCH session-entity, POST viewer-events, POST intent, POST report-render ×2) + the messages-hydrate GET
  whose `chat_session_forbidden` is now reconciled onto `not_session_owner`. Failing-first
  `sessionOwnership.test.ts` (7 cases: red — module absent; green after) covers authed-owns/not,
  authed-vs-anon-row, anon-owns/not, anon-vs-user-row, and the canonical error code. Behavior-preserving
  for the 6 (verbatim same predicate) + the existing 200-path test on the messages route (anon session on
  an anon row still owns) + the `not_session_owner` 403 test on `/api/intent` (unchanged + green). The
  messages route's reconciliation is a security-tightening of one untested edge (authed read of an
  unclaimed-anon row) onto the more-correct model — no test regressed. The app-side fixture mock in
  `chatSessions.test.ts:453` was updated `chat_session_forbidden → not_session_owner` to reflect the
  unified contract (it is a stubbed body, NOT an assertion — the test asserts only `status: 403`). ZERO
  `ownedByUser`/`ownedByAnon`/`ownsVia*`/`chat_session_forbidden`/inline-`"not_session_owner"` remain in
  `app.ts` (grep); middleware suite 665 green.

### 4e. Round-trip / dead-plumbing closeout (→ SEQUENTIAL/TDD)
- [ ] **#17 §9 closeout.** Each persist chain gets a reader+writer or is DROPPED (the `attachments_json`
  precedent): `chat_sessions` `viewer_history/overlays/workspace` cols (mutators issue no PATCH → NULL
  on reload — wire a viewer PATCH or delete cols + `chatSessionPatch` + the migration + `hydrateViewer`);
  `chat_messages` telemetry cols (written never read); `intent_log` (`listIntentLog` test-only). Per
  item, a dead-column grep guard.
  — PARTIAL (step 2-7g — the `chat_messages` write-only/dead cols DROPPED with a guard; the larger
  `viewer_*`-column drop scoped out → checkbox stays `[ ]`). **chat_messages (DONE):**
  `tool_calls_json` was WRITE-ONLY (chatHandler wrote `reply.tools`, nothing ever read it back into
  app/LLM context) and `attachments_json` was DEAD (always written NULL, never read) — confirmed by grep
  (no client reader; the messages-hydrate route projects only `citations`). Adding a reader would surface
  tool-calls to the client (new behavior, out of scope), so both were DROPPED: the CREATE-TABLE columns,
  the `appendChatMessage` INSERT, the `listChatMessages` SELECT, `rowToChatMessage`, the
  `ChatMessageRecord.toolCallsJson`/`attachmentsJson` type fields, and the two chatHandler write sites —
  plus the now-stale `null` fixture fields across 6 test files. **Dead-column grep guard (failing-first):**
  new `mysqlRepository.test.ts` case asserts the DDL/INSERT/SELECT statements contain neither
  `tool_calls_json` nor `attachments_json` (red — both present; green after the drop) — fires if either is
  reintroduced. (These cols are CREATE-TABLE-only — no separate ALTER migration to touch.) Behavior-
  preserving (no reader existed). Middleware suite 668 green, tsc clean. **intent_log:** NOT a dead chain —
  it has a real WRITER (chatHandler + the `/api/intent` POST route) AND a reader method (`listIntentLog`);
  a read-API whose only current caller is tests is not "no reader," so it is correctly left intact.
  **NOT DONE — `viewer_history/overlays/workspace` (genuinely larger drop, deferred):** confirmed dead in
  PRACTICE — the read+write+migration chain exists end-to-end, but the app mutators only ever PATCH
  `activeEntityKey`/`currentIntent` (`ChatStoreContext` patchPayloads), NEVER the viewer slots, so the cols
  are write-NULL-only. Closing this means dropping 3 JSON cols + their ALTER migration (with its
  `information_schema` probe + dedicated migration test) + the PATCH-route viewer-field validation +
  `chatSessionPatch`/`chatSessionsList` viewer fields + the hydrate read path across ~4 more test files —
  a wide change that risks the behavior-preserving guarantee; left honestly open rather than rushed.

### 4f. LOW UI cleanups (⟲ WORKFLOW-OK, independent)
- [ ] **LOW — scenario capability flag:** `ExtractView.tsx` `supportsJsonRender = scenarioId === "loan"`
  → read a `ScenarioConfig` capability flag (data, not a hardcoded-id branch).
- [ ] **LOW — `PasswordField` primitive:** extract the show/hide toggle duplicated across `LoginForm`/
  `RegisterForm`/`ConfirmChangePasswordForm` into `components/primitives/PasswordField`.

## 5. Recurrence drift-guards + reconciliation matrix
**Execution: ◑ MIXED.** The `_template/` scaffold update + reconciliation-matrix doc + checklist are
→ SEQUENTIAL (single docs/scaffold edits). The 5 drift guards (a–e) are ⟲ WORKFLOW-OK — each an
independent test file with its own pass/fail. **AUTHOR THESE AFTER the bases they guard exist** (§2,
§3, §4) — a guard for a missing base would be vacuous.

- [x] **Update the `components/_template/` scaffold:** add a `ScopedViewerWidget` variant (scope prop +
  `show_*` tool + registry) for viewer widgets; reference `docs/agents/data-model.md` + the shared bases.
  — DONE: added `components/_template/ScopedViewerTemplate.{tsx,tools.ts,test.tsx}` — the copy-me exemplar
  for a ScopedViewerWidget. `.tsx` declares the REQUIRED non-`none` `scope: ContentScope` + `role`, drives
  its demo load from `useScopeAdapter(scope, …)` (the base scope-identity hook). `.tools.ts` exports a
  canvas-dispatch `show_template_surface` tool + a commented `defineScopedViewerWidget({id,kind,slot,tools})`
  descriptor template (commented so the un-copied scaffold doesn't need a new `CanvasKind` to compile) and
  points at `widgets/scopedViewerWidgetRegistryProduction.ts` (the sole mount path). README gained a
  "two variants ship here" note + a `## ScopedViewerWidget variant` section referencing
  `docs/agents/data-model.md` "New viewer surface" + `template-scope-results.md` + the shared bases
  (`@groundx/shared` `ContentScope`/`contentScopeSchema`, `@/widgets/scopedViewerWidget`
  `defineScopedViewerWidget`/`useScopeAdapter`/`scopeKey`). `_template` is skipped by the widget-contract +
  tool-quality walkers (`_`-prefix), so it doesn't pollute the catalog; the new `show_template_surface`
  tool got a matrix row (`widget-access-matrix.md` §3 walks `_template`, as it does for `edit_template`).
- [x] **Cross-layer reconciliation matrix** — maintain (in `docs/agents/data-model.md`) a concept ×
  layer matrix (app type · wire/middleware type · DB column · persisted JSON) asserting agreement.
  — DONE: added the "## Cross-layer reconciliation matrix (concept × layer — assert agreement)" table in
  `docs/agents/data-model.md` (right under the "before you add" checklist). 10 rows — Citation,
  ContentScope, Template, GeneratedResult, ViewerStepKind, CanvasIntent, ViewerEvent, ApiError,
  SuggestedAction, Tool — each naming the app type · wire/middleware type · DB column(s) · persisted JSON ·
  the reconciler (the shared Zod schema / sanitizer / drift guard). `—` marks a layer the concept doesn't
  reach. Also refreshed the stale rows the §2/§4 work invalidated: the ApiError rows (now "extends shared
  ApiError"), the `chat_messages` cols row (dead cols dropped §4e), the union-typed DB columns row (Zod
  coerce §4c), `WidgetTool`/`ServerTool` rows (`rendersWidget?`).
- [x] **Drift guards** (failing-first against current tree, then fail loudly): (a) a `viewer-widget`
  that doesn't build on `ScopedViewerWidget` / lacks a `show_*` tool; (b) a duplicate exported type name
  across files; (c) a `Record<string,unknown>` placeholder in a context's typed state; (d) a `*Error`
  not extending the base `ApiError`; (e) a persisted DB column with no in-memory type field.
  — DONE: 5 NON-vacuous guards, each PROVEN to fire by a temporary fork (then reverted), green on the
  current tree. App-side in `app/src/test/recurrence-drift-guards.test.ts`: (a) every `viewer-widgets/<Name>/`
  calls `defineScopedViewerWidget(...)` + declares ≥1 canvas-dispatch tool (the `show_*` LITERAL is NOT
  hard-required — the base descriptor deliberately accepts the full allowlisted verb set, so PdfViewer's
  `open_`/`jump_` register cleanly; verb prefix is policed by `check-tool-quality`, per the
  `scopedViewerWidget.ts` header — requiring `show_` would FALSE-fail PdfViewer; documented `SignUpWidget`/
  `BookCallView`/`GateValueProp` overlay exemptions); (b) no exported type/interface name DECLARED in >1
  file (re-exports excluded — they ARE the unification mechanism; `ReportSectionRenderAs` is a TRACKED §4b
  inline-wire-twin not yet folded → documented `DUP_TYPE_NAME_EXEMPT` entry, NOT a fake-pass; the guard
  still fires on any NEW dup, and a sanity test force-deletes the entry once §4b folds it); (c) no
  `*State` interface FIELD typed `Record<string,unknown>` (the `currentIntent` placeholder B1 collapsed —
  scoped to `interface *State {…}` bodies only, so the legit serialization escape hatches `detail?:
  CanvasIntent|Record<…>` + the localStorage-snapshot shapes are NOT flagged); (d) no app `class XError
  extends Error` (must extend shared `ApiError`). Middleware-side in
  `middleware/src/db/persistedColumnPolicy.test.ts`: (e) every persisted DATA column on the guarded tables
  (`viewer_events`, `intent_log`) is read into its `rowTo*` mapper (`row.<col>`) — the §4e write-only/dead
  `tool_calls_json`/`attachments_json` regression would turn this RED; PK/FK/INDEX clauses skipped, per-table
  documented `structuralExempt` + a stale-exemption sanity test; (d-middleware) no middleware `*Error
  extends Error`. Fork proofs: (a) renaming the descriptor call, (b) a PascalCase dup decl in two files,
  (c) a `Record<…>` field injected into a `*State` body, (d) a probe `XError extends Error`, (e) a write-only
  DDL column — each flipped the relevant guard RED, green after revert.
- [x] **Chat-widget reachability guard (migrated from `core-data-model-hardening` on its 2026-05-31
  archive — the canvas `CanvasKind` registry covers VIEWER widgets only; chat widgets mount imperatively
  in `ChatColumn`).** For TOOL-triggered cards (`propose_schema_field`→ProposeSchemaFieldCard,
  `book_call`→BookingStatusCard, `save_to_account`/`suggestedActions`→SuggestedActionChips): add a
  `rendersWidget?: "<slot>/<name>"` binding on the relevant `*.tools.ts` + `SERVER_TOOL_CATALOG` entries
  + a coverage test (every UI-card tool names a real mounted chat widget; every tool-triggered chat widget
  is named by ≥1 tool), riding the existing app↔server tool-catalog parity guard — not a second list.
  Always-on widgets (ThinkingStream, input bar, GateChatRail-by-gate-state) are a DELIBERATE exemption
  covered by `ChatColumn`'s render tests. Phase 2 (data-driven `ChatColumn` dispatch registry) deferred —
  earn the axis first. (`knip --production` backstop was DROPPED on the hardening archive: the mandatory
  sibling-test rule defeats it, and registry-as-sole-mount-path + the ESLint import ban are the real
  orphan catches.)
  — DONE: added an OPTIONAL `rendersWidget?: string` ("<slot>/<Name>") to `WidgetTool` (app
  `tools/types.ts`) + `ServerTool` (middleware `services/toolCatalog.ts`). Bound the 3 enumerated cards on
  BOTH sides (REAL mounted widgets — verified each is mounted off-tools: ProposeSchemaFieldCard in
  `conversation/chatPrimitives.tsx`, BookingStatusCard in OnboardingShell/CanvasOrchestrator,
  SuggestedActionChips in `chatPrimitives.tsx`): `propose_schema_field`→`chat-widgets/ProposeSchemaFieldCard`,
  `book_call`→`chat-widgets/BookingStatusCard`, `save_to_account`→`chat-widgets/SuggestedActionChips` (the
  `openGate` chip surfaces via the suggestedActions renderer). Coverage test RIDES the existing
  `app/src/tools/catalog-parity.test.ts` (the only place that imports BOTH catalogs — NOT a second list):
  4 new tests assert (1) each enumerated card declares the binding app-side, (2) the SAME binding server-side
  (parity), (3) every binding (either catalog) resolves to a real mounted `chat-widgets/<Name>/` dir, (4)
  every tool that DECLARES a binding is enumerated (direction-2 — no untracked binding). Failing-first
  (bindings absent → 3 RED), then green; a fork pointing a binding at a non-existent widget flips the
  dangling-binding test RED (then reverted). Always-on widgets are NOT bound (deliberate exemption); Phase-2
  data-driven dispatch stays deferred (these 3 are the only real consumers — axis not yet earned).
- [x] **Docs/memory:** the "before you add a widget/type/tool/context" checklist lives in
  `docs/agents/data-model.md` header + AGENTS.md + memory, so future agents consult it.
  — DONE: rewrote the `data-model.md` "Before you add a widget / type / tool / context (READ THIS FIRST)"
  header — the bases are now SHIPPED (not "planned"/"not yet shipped"), and EACH bullet names the
  recurrence drift guard that turns RED if the debt comes back (§5(a)–(e) + reachability + parity), so the
  checklist is guard-backed, not aspirational. Added the new bullets the §5 work introduced (chat-card
  `rendersWidget` binding, persisted-column round-trip). Updated the AGENTS.md data-model.md ToC line to
  point at the reconciliation matrix + the guard-backing + the same checklist summary. (Memory entry left
  to the orchestrator/closeout — this step owns the in-repo docs; the MEMORY.md index is a personal store,
  not a committed repo file.)

## 6. Deferred DB sweep — drop extraction_schemas (SOAK-GATED — NOT READY)
**Execution: → SEQUENTIAL (deploy-gated).** This task is **GATED, not ready.** It MUST NOT be started
until the `templates` migration has soaked one release in production and the gate below is confirmed.

- [ ] **UNBLOCK (soak gate):** confirm the `templates` migration has been live one release AND a code
  sweep shows zero readers/writers of `extraction_schemas` remain (Phase-3 cutover removed them). Only
  after this passes may the drop task below begin.
- [ ] **(gated on the UNBLOCK above)** Drop the `extraction_schemas` table AND in the same change remove
  the boot copy-migration `INSERT…SELECT … FROM extraction_schemas` in `mysqlRepository.ts` (it reads
  that table; leaving it after the drop breaks `createSchema`/startup) AND drop the now-orphan
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS extraction_schemas`. A migration test confirms a fresh boot + `createSchema`
  succeed with the table gone.

## Closeout
**Execution: → SEQUENTIAL (gate).** A single serial gate, never a workflow.

- [ ] `openspec validate --all --strict` green; `scaffold/app` + `scaffold/middleware` suites green;
  widget-contract + no-hardcoded-styles + tool-quality guards green.
- [ ] Update `docs/agents/data-model.md` (remove the resolved duplicates/placeholders from the facts table).
- [ ] Archive.
